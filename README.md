<b> Assignment_1_Simple_Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb</b> -> Example Code Base

<b>Assignment1_Experiments.ipynb</b>:
  1. Reimplement the example in the code base. 
  2. Conduct experiments with different optimizers: SGD, Adam, Adagrad, and record the experimental results 
  3. Use Adam optimizer, conduct experiments with different numbers of epochs: 5, 10, 20, and 50. 
  4. Use Adam optimizer, 50 epochs, and randomly initialized embeddings, run the experiments with the following models:
     * One-layer feed forward neural network, hidden dimension is 500.
     *  Two-layer feed forward neural network, hidden dimensions are 500 and 300.
     *  Three-layer feed-forward neural network, hidden dimensions are 500, 300, and 200
     *  CNN model (using three feature maps with the sizes of feature map are 1, 2, and 3)
     *  LSTM model
     *  Bi-LSTM model

<b>Assignment1_analysis.ipynb</b> -> Plots to visualize the training loss, training accuracy, validation loss and validation accuracy during the model training.
